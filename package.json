# Making the Invite Feature More Visible

## Current Issue
The room code is in a small sidebar card. Users might miss it.

## Solutions to Add:

### 1. Add "Invite Friends" Button to Header
```jsx
<button className="bg-blue-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg">
  Invite Friends
</button>
```

### 2. Show Invite Modal with:
- Large room code
- Copy button
- Shareable text message
- "Share via..." options

### 3. First-time Prompt
After creating room, show:
"Your room is ready! Invite friends to compete"

### 4. Empty State
If you're the only person in room:
"You're competing alone! Invite friends to make it fun"

## Quick Fix for Now:

Look in the right sidebar for "ROOM CODE" section.
The code is there - click the copy button to share it!
